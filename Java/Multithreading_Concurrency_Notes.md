## Intro

**Benefits of Multithreading**

- Better CPU utilization.
- Simpler program design in some situations.
- More responsive programs.
- More fair division of CPU resources between different tasks.

**Cons of Multithreading**

- More complex design _(More synchronization required)_.
- Context switching overhead _(CPU switching from one thread to another)_.
- Increased resource consumption _(memory consumption more)._
